block09

This is a mock personal website for the fictional client, Calliope, for a FullStack Academy project.

- Site requires a Home page, About page, and Portfolio page in addition to a CSS stylesheet and JavaScript file.

Features:

- Multiple commits and branches
- A persistent header with links
- Formatted text and images
- Includes basic CSS styling via external file
- Includes a JavaScript call to console.log with the string "Hello World" loaded onto all pages as an external script

# Personal-Website-Pt-2

block12

This is a continuation of my mock personal website which will have some more features added upon the foundation.

- Site requires updating the use of a form or grid system and dynamic styling with hover effects. Also, the site now needs a form system on a contact page that redirects you to another page on submit.

Features:

- New contact and success html pages that work with the form system
- More complex styling
- The use of a grid or flex system in the body structure
